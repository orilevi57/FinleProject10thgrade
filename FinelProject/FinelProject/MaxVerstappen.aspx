    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        He’s Max by name, and max by nature.<br />
        Arriving as Formula 1’s youngest ever competitor
        at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his car,<br />
        his rivals and the sport’s record books to the limit.
        The baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took<br />
        the Toro Rosso – and then the Red Bull – by the
        horns with his instinctive racing style.<br />
        F1’s youngest points scorer soon became its
        youngest race winner – at the age of 18 years<br />
        and 228 days – with an opportunistic but controlled
        drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016.<br /> 
        A true wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive
        in Brazil from the back of the pack to the podium on a<br />
        treacherous wet track kept the plaudits coming.
        Verstappen’s no-holds-barred attitude and hard<br />
        defending have sometimes landed him in hot water with
        his peers and paymasters. But the mistakes that<br />
        initially marred his potential have given way<br />
        to maturity, while the bravado and energy that make
        him a blockbuster talent have remained – and the<br />
        victories have kept on coming.
        They led to his first F1 drivers’ crown<br />
        after that now legendary, final-round showdown
        with Lewis Hamilton in 2021 and he followed<br /> 
        that up with a powerhouse title defence in 2022.
        An epic third successive championship triumph<br />
        featured a record 19 wins from 23 Grands Prix, and
        he held on for a fourth in 2024, despite Red Bull<br />
        falling off the pace towards the end of the campaign.
        The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and<br />
        super-quick karting Mum Sophie Kumpen, racing runs
        through his genes. Despite moving out of Dad’s<br />
        house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close
        to his family, and though he’s not afraid to speak<br />
        his mind, he can still be surprisingly shy.
        Having become the Netherlands' first world champion<br />
        aged just 24, the expectations for the new generation’s
        leading light are sky high – but with Verstappen<br />
        there’s a feeling that the sky’s the limit.
