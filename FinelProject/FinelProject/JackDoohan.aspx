    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        Alpine’s F1 reserve since 2023, Jack Doohan steps up to full-time racer for 2025,<br />
        having been handed an early Grand Prix debut for the team at 2024’s season finale.<br />
        Doohan is the latest Aussie to join the F1 grid, and the young Queenslander is<br />
        not short of racing pedigree – he already has plenty of F3 and F2 wins to his name, and that’s<br />
        before we mention his father, five-time motorcycle world champion, Mick.<br />
        After his single-seater debut in British Formula 4, followed by stints in Italian F4,<br />
        ADAC F4 and Asian F3, Doohan stepped up to FIA Formula 3 in 2020, finishing<br />
        championship runner-up the following year. The 2022 season saw him join Alpine’s driver<br />
        development programme and finish sixth overall in his rookie FIA Formula 2 campaign.<br />
        The following year he was up to third, thanks to three race wins, including impressive<br />
        back-to-back feature race victories in Hungary and Belgium.<br />
        Formula 1 experience came via Alpine, with free practice outings at Grands Prix in 2022,<br />
        2023 and 2024. And having served his apprenticeship with the French squad, Doohan’s reward<br />
        is a shot at the big time as team mate to F1 race winner Pierre Gasly.
