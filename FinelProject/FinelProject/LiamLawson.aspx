    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        Liam Lawson knows a thing or two about jumping in at the deep end.<br />
        A race winner at pretty much every level of junior motorsport, and a front-runner<br />
        in the highly competitive F3 and F2 championships, the New Zealander was keenly<br />
        awaiting his F1 chance as Red Bull’s reserve driver when a twist of fate presented it.<br />
        With AlphaTauri racer Daniel Ricciardo breaking his hand in a practice crash at the 2023<br />
        Dutch Grand Prix, Lawson – inspired as a youngster by the Lightning McQueen character<br />
        from the Disney animation Cars – was ready to strike.<br />
        After a sink-or-swim debut in the relentless rain at Zandvoort, the entire paddock<br />
        stood up and took notice amid the intense humidity of Singapore, where the rookie brilliantly<br />
        beat world champion Max Verstappen to a Q3 spot and bagged some valuable points on race day.<br />
        Red Bull told Lawson just before his stellar qualifying run under the Marina Bay lights<br />
        that there would be no room at the inn for 2024, with a rebranded RB team combining experience<br />
        and youth once more in the healed Ricciardo and Yuki Tsunoda.<br />
        Lawson had been in this position before, though. He underlined his talents to Red Bull’s<br />
        chiefs when it mattered most and just needed to wait for the next opportunity to arise.<br />
        Of all the places for it to unfold, Singapore triggered a second twist of fate. Ricciardo would<br />
        be out, and Lawson back in, this time as Red Bull tried to understand the “bigger picture”<br />
        with their driver line-ups for 2025 and beyond.<br />
        It marked a golden opportunity for Lawson to not only cement himself in RB colours, but also<br />
        knock on the door of a Red Bull promotion - which is exactly what he got, when he was announced<br />
        as Sergio Perez's replacement as Max Verstappen's team mate for 2025.<br />
        It's been a whirlwind F1 career to date and only time will tell where the adventure takes Lawson next.
