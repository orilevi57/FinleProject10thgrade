    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        He’s the Superhero with the talent to become a racing superstar – if only he could<br />
        get to flex his muscles with a top team. F1’s 'Hulk' has shown incredible strength<br />
        and stamina as a midfield marauder for Williams, Force India, Sauber, Renault,<br />
        Racing Point, Aston Martin, Haas and Kick Sauber during a career spanning back to 2010.<br />
        In that rookie season, Hulkenberg mastered changing track conditions to take a brilliant<br />
        pole position in Brazil, showing he had brains as well as brawn. Since then his ability<br />
        to consistently hoover up the points has made him a highly valued team player. In 2015,<br />
        his reputation grew once more when, on a weekend away from his day job, he won the classic Le Mans<br />
        24 Hours race for Porsche at the first time of asking.<br />
        Hulkenberg’s off-track alter ego is down to earth – he’s the sort of driver who holds<br />
        his own umbrella when it’s raining on the way to the grid – with a cheeky sense of humour.<br />
        When he reached the unwanted record of most race starts without a podium finish he laughed it off<br />
        as the start of the 'Hulkenberg era'. Thankfully, even after being dropped by Renault at the end of<br />
        2019, the popular German’s era continued with some stand-in (and stand-out) drives in 2020 and 2022,<br />
        and after landing a full-time F1 return with Haas for 2023, the ‘Hulk’ embraced<br />
        another chance to set the record straight. Teaming up with rookie Gabriel Bortoleto at Kick Sauber<br />
        for 2025, Hulkenberg will be hoping the team that will become the Audi works squad for 2026 can<br />
        finally bring him that elusive F1 podium - and more.
