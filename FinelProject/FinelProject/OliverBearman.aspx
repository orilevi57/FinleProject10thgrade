    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        As an official Ferrari reserve he made his F1 race debut in Saudi Arabia 2024 in place of the ill Carlos Sainz.<br />
        That was after the young Bearman had got his first taste of F1 machinery with the Scuderia towards the<br />
        end of 2023, in preparation for a pair of FP1 outings for Haas at the Mexican and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix.<br />
        He would go on to complete several more F1 test runs whilst also competing in F2 with the Prema<br />
        Racing team, winning four races and placing sixth in the feeder series standings that year.<br />
        After a tough start to the 2024 campaign for Prema in Bahrain, Bearman struck back to claim pole<br />
        position at the high-speed Jeddah track but, with Sainz-subbing duties calling,<br />
        he was required to temporarily drop his F2 commitments.<br />
        Not that he was complaining - a stunning performance saw the young Englishman<br />
        score six points for seventh place in his first Grand Prix, enhancing his future F1 prospects no end.<br />
        Indeed, that drive helped him secure a full-time F1 seat with the Ferrari-powered Haas<br />
        squad for 2025 – as well as an early Grand Prix debut with them in Azerbaijan ’24,<br />
        as team regular Kevin Magnussen served out a one-race ban.
