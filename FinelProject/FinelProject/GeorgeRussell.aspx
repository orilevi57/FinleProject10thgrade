    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        He’s the driver with the motto: “If in doubt, go flat out”.<br />
        George Russell has lived by it throughout his F1 career to date, out-qualifying<br />
        seasoned team mate Robert Kubica at all 21 Grands Prix in his rookie season,<br />
        putting Williams back on the podium in 2021, and landing his first race win with Mercedes in 2022.<br />
        That brilliant baseline speed served Russell well as he totted up titles on his way to Formula 1.<br />
        The Briton stormed to the 2017 GP3 championship and delivered the 2018 Formula 2 crown under immense pressure.<br />
        Spotting his potential, world champions Mercedes swooped to sign him to their junior programme in 2017,<br />
        when Russell already had a DTM deal on the table. He banked more experience with practice sessions<br />
        with Force India and tests for the Silver Arrows, before landing his Mercedes-powered Williams race drive.<br />
        A refusal to cede ground to his rivals - and commitment to a tricky pass – underpins Russell’s<br />
        winning mentality. And it’s what got him the call-up to replace Lewis Hamilton for a one-off<br />
        Mercedes appearance for Sakhir 2020 when the reigning champ was struck down by Covid-19.<br />
        That star turn saw Russell miss out on pole by just 0.026s and then outrace Mercedes<br />
        stalwart Valtteri Bottas. Only a bungled pit stop and a heart-breaking late puncture<br />
        prevented a near-certain maiden win for the up-and-coming super-sub.<br />
        He kept his head down at Williams in 2021, scoring his first points and podium,<br />
        all the while keeping his eye on the bigger prize. Having proved himself a hard worker<br />
        and a tenacious talent, that prize arrived in the form of a chance to take on<br />
        compatriot and seven-time champion Hamilton in identical machinery.<br />
        It was an opportunity Russell has relished, and he took his first F1 win – and Mercedes’<br />
        only 2022 victory – in Brazil. The 2023 season proved tougher, but he was again atop<br />
        the podium twice in 2024 and for 2025 he leads the team following Hamilton's departure for Ferrari.<br />
        And if the Silver Arrows can bounce back and provide a truly competitive car, a title bid<br />
        surely beckons - a huge challenge, but as always, ‘Russell the Rocket’ will be going flat out.
