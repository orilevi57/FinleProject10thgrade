    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        If there’s one man who knows how big a rollercoaster ride an F1 driver’s career can be, it’s Pierre Gasly!<br />
        The flying Frenchman was called up to make his 2017 debut in Malaysia in place of Daniil Kvyat and,<br />
        after proving his mettle, he was named a Toro Rosso driver the following year. A further<br />
        21 races into his fledgling career, Gasly was moved up again – this time to replace Red Bull<br />
        big gun Daniel Ricciardo. Gasly seemed to have a knack of being in the right place at the right<br />
        time – a quality that’s equally handy on track. A series of impressive 2018 performances for<br />
        Toro Rosso – including a brilliant fourth place in Bahrain – showed exciting promise for what he<br />
        might do with the ‘A’ team in 2019. Unfortunately that promise only appeared in flashes – and he quickly<br /> 
        suffered from unfavourable comparisons with superstar team mate Max Verstappen. So much so that after<br />
        the summer break, he was sent back to Toro Rosso, with another young up-and-comer – Alex Albon – being<br />
        given a shot in the ‘senior’ Red Bull seat.<br />
        But Gasly bounced back, as only Gasly can. In the season’s remaining nine races he scored almost as many<br />
        points as team mate Kvyat managed over the entire year – and secured his best-ever race result with P2 in Brazil.<br />
        That trajectory continued in 2020, peaking with an emotional maiden win at the renamed AlphaTauri<br />
        team’s home race in Italy, and didn’t let up in 2021 when he was back on the podium and scored<br />
        110 of the squad’s 142 points. When AlphaTauri’s momentum stalled in 2022, Gasly decided it was<br />
        time for a change – in the form of French squad Alpine. It’s a move that has occasionally put him<br />
        back on the podium, but the question now is can he gather momentum and get himself another shot at the F1 bigtime…
