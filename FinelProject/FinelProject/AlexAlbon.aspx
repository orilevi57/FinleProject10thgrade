    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        Born in London but racing under the flag of Thailand, Alexander Albon’s first<br />
        word was in fact Italian. That word was Ferrari – though it was with another<br />
        Italian team that he got his big F1 break.<br />
        Idolising Michael Schumacher and dreaming of one day racing in Formula 1,<br />
        the junior Albon was pipped to the 2016 GP3 title by a certain Charles Leclerc.<br />
        He then left his great friendship with George Russell trackside as he<br />
        took the 2018 Formula 2 title fight down to the wire.<br />
        Graduating to the F1 big league along with yet another contemporary – Lando Norris – in<br />
        2019, Albon did his talking on track with Toro Rosso in the opening races,<br />
        earning a mid-season promotion to Red Bull Racing.<br />
        A stylish overtaker with a championship mentality, Albon was unfazed by<br />
        partnering Max Verstappen for the second half of his rookie season,<br />
        taking top-six finishes in eight of his nine 2019 races with Red Bull.<br />
        Staying in touch with the future champion proved tougher in 2020 and Red Bull<br />
        dropped him from their race line-up. Crucially, though, Albon was retained as test<br />
        and reserve driver, keeping him very much on team bosses’ radar, leading to his<br />
        2022 return to the grid with Williams, where he has established a<br />
        reputation as a fast qualifier and mature racer.<br />
        Laidback and cheerful with a cheeky grin, the Thai driver is popular<br />
        among his peers – not always easy in motorsport’s cauldron of<br />
        competition – but you don’t succeed in Formula 1 by being popular.<br />
        Albon’s challenge remains a big one – to make the most of a rare second F1 opportunity.
