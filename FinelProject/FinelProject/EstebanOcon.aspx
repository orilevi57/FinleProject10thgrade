    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
       If there’s one word that dominates Esteban Ocon’s career, it’s ‘sacrifice’.<br />
       Back when he was just a promising karter, Ocon’s parents sold their house, put their<br />
        jobs on hold, and began a life on the road, living in a caravan and travelling<br />
        from circuit to circuit to support their son’s burgeoning career.<br />
       Sacrifice, see – but it worked. 2014 saw Ocon break through in the world of single-seaters,<br />
        as he beat a certain Max Verstappen to the European F3 title. Backed by Mercedes, he won the<br />
        GP3 title the following year and was halfway through a season of DTM in 2016 when he was offered<br />
        the chance to replace Rio Haryanto at the minnow Manor team from the Belgian Grand Prix onwards.<br />
       That opportunity led to a full-time seat the following year with Force India, where his<br />
        wheel-to-wheel duels with highly-rated team mate Sergio Perez quickly marked him out as a rising star.<br />
        But when Lawrence Stroll, father of racer Lance, stepped in midway through 2018 to secure the<br />
        squad’s financial future, the writing was on the wall for Ocon, who was moved aside at the end of<br />
        the year to allow Stroll Jnr to join from Williams.<br />
       Ocon bided his time, though, and after a year on the sidelines as Mercedes’ reserve driver,<br />
        he found his way back into a race seat for 2020 with Renault, who became Alpine for 2021 – when his<br />
        wait finally paid off, as he scored his – and the famous French marque’s – first F1 win.<br />
       Nothing in Ocon’s motorsport career has come easy – but if Ocon has managed to return to the F1<br />
        grid and step atop the podium, it’s through a combination of self-belief,<br />
        determination and a talent that’s up there with the very best.
