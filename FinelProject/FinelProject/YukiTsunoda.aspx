    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        In the entire history of Formula 1, no Japanese driver has ever won a World Championship Grand Prix.<br />
        Could Yuki Tsunoda be the first? Red Bull certainly think so, with the youngster very much on the<br />
        path to their senior team if he continues to impress as he has done over the past few years.<br />
        Tsunoda's ascent to the top tier of motorsport was astonishingly rapid: he went from racing in<br />
        Japanese F4 to a Formula 1 seat with AlphaTauri, now Racing Bulls, in just over three years,<br />
        having arrived in Europe in 2019 with no knowledge of the circuits.<br />
        But after a slow start in F3, followed by a hugely impressive debut F2 campaign that saw him<br />
        finish third in the championship and pick up three wins along the way, Tsunoda proved<br />
        he had the speed and the race craft to force his way on to the F1 grid.<br />
        He may not have adapted to Grand Prix racing quite as quickly as he did to F2, but<br />
        having now firmly established himself in Formula 1, he could yet<br />
        find himself battling at the very sharp end in a Red Bull.
