    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        Lando Norris may not be named after Star Wars rebel Lando Calrissian - his Mum just<br /> 
        liked the moniker - but he has flair and fighting spirit in bountiful supply.<br />
        McLaren had the British teenager on their books for two years before fast-tracking<br /> 
        him into F1’s galaxy of stars in 2019. A firecracker in his junior career, with a<br />
        penchant for pole positions and wheel-to-wheel tussles, Norris didn’t let them down.<br />
        Paired with the highly-rated – and far more experienced – Carlos Sainz, his rookie season<br /> 
        was impressive, Norris edging the Spaniard in their head-to-head qualifying battle, scoring points<br />
        11 times, and only narrowly missing out on a top-10 championship placing.<br />
        A maiden podium came in 2020, with more following in the subsequent two<br />
        seasons – he narrowly missed out on a win at Russia 2021 – as he dominated<br />
        another more senior team mate, Daniel Ricciardo, to firmly establish himself<br />
        in F1’s top tier.<br />
        It was the 2024 season that finally brought Norris his breakthrough<br />
        win – along with three more – as he became the biggest challenger<br />
        to Max Verstappen’s drivers’ crown and led McLaren to their<br />
        first constructors’ title since 1998.<br />
        Away from the track, Norris brims with a modest charm and an<br />
        artistic side sees him design and paint his own race gear<br />
        as a hobby. The focus for the future is allying artistry<br />
        and ambition on track as McLaren rely on the promise of<br />
        youth to take them back to the top.<br />
        Norris hopes the downforce will be with him…
