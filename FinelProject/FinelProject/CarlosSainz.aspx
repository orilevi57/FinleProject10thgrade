    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        He’s the matador from Madrid racing royalty.

        After entering F1’s Bull Ring paired alongside Max Verstappen at Toro Rosso in 2015,<br />
        Sainz quickly showed his fighting spirit. A tenacious racer, he puts the car on the<br />
        edge as he hustles his way through the pack. No wonder Sainz has earned the nickname Chilli.<br />
        But the Spaniard is intelligent as well as instinctive, thinking his way through a<br />
        race and into the points. This calm temperament follows him off track where he remains<br />
        unfazed by the pressures of forging a Grand Prix career with a famous name.<br />
        Sainz is the son of double World Rally champion, also his namesake, and has brought<br />
        some of Dad’s driving skills to the F1 circuit – junior loves a delicious dose of drift for one.<br />
        After following in his famous father’s tyre tracks, Sainz has had big racing<br />
        boots to fill – first at McLaren where he replaced his childhood hero Fernando Alonso,<br />
        and now at Ferrari, in the seat formerly owned by Sebastian Vettel.<br />
        It is never easy living in the shadow of sporting giants, but Sainz has shown<br />
        the drive and disposition to deal with it, scoring four Grand Prix victories<br />
        during his time with Scuderia seasons before moving to his latest challenge at Williams. Vamos!
