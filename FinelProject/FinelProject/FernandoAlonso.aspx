    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        Michael Schumacher was the undisputed king of Formula 1 in the early 2000s,<br />
        picking up wins and championships at a rate that was simply unheard of at the time.<br />
        It was going to take someone very special to topple the Ferrari legend from his<br />
        throne – and that it was Fernando Alonso who did it, tells you all you need to know about the Spaniard.<br />
        Fiercely competitive, Alonso is not shy about his talent, rating himself as 9/10 “in everything”,<br />
        and few in the know would disagree, with his performances in F1 characterised by blistering speed,<br />
        brilliant tactical thinking, exemplary race craft, a razor-sharp eye for detail and a relentless<br />
        determination to win.A serial record breaker in his early days, he was – at one time – F1’s youngest<br />
        polesitter, race winner, world champion and double world champion as he gobbled up success with the Renault team.<br />
        Even Alonso couldn’t continue that amazing run in his later career though, failing to add another<br />
        title to his collection despite spells at McLaren and Ferrari.<br />
        But after two years away from Formula 1 racing – and with two Le Mans wins in his<br />
        pocket – Alonso returned with Alpine in 2021. His speed and determination undiminished,<br />
        he was back on the podium that year, but frustrated by poor reliability – and the lack of a<br />
        long-term contract – the following season, he opted to jump ship once more.<br />
        After eight podiums in his first season with Aston Martin, he has since become the first man<br />
        to reach 400 Grand Prix starts. And with tech legend Adrian Newey joining in 2025, Alonso now<br />
        hopes it will be with the team in green that he finally returns to winning ways, as he has<br />
         unfinished business with F1…
