    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        Born in Melbourne, just a stone’s throw away from the Australian Grand Prix venue, a young<br />
        Oscar Piastri’s dreams of one day racing in Formula 1 were ignited by the sport’s star<br />
        drivers roaring around his local streets, otherwise known as Albert Park.<br />
        But it would take huge commitment and sacrifice to turn that dream into a reality,<br />
        with a move to Europe – made by the likes of fellow countrymen Mark Webber and Daniel<br />
        Ricciardo before him – the only way to go up against the best and catch the<br />
        attention of the sport’s decision-makers.<br />
        Using success on the Australian karting scene as a springboard,<br />
        Piastri continued to learn the craft in championships across Europe, before<br />
        getting his first taste of single-seater competition as a 15-year-old – two<br />
        podium finishes in F4 UAE a sign of things to come.<br />
        From there, success flowed. British F4 runner-up. Formula Renault champion.<br />
        F3 champion. F2 champion (by more than 50 points). Piastri did not simply<br />
        climb the junior single-seater ladder, he charged up it to knock loudly on the F1 door.<br />
        So impressive was Piastri that two F1 teams squabbled over his services for 2023,<br />
        adding a new dimension to the driver market and so-called ‘silly season’.<br />
        McLaren, and not long-time backers Alpine, won out and their rookie repaid<br />
        them in spades, taking two podiums in a highly impressive debut campaign.<br />
        It was no flash in the pan. In 2024 Piastri proved vital in McLaren securing their<br />
        first constructors' title since 1998, pushing more experienced team mate Lando Norris<br />
        all the way and scoring Grand Prix wins in Hungary and Azerbaijan to finish fourth in the driver standings.
