    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        Born in the Mediterranean idyll of Monaco, Leclerc arrived in F1 on a tidal wave of expectation.<br />
        Practically peerless on his way to the GP3 and Formula 2 crowns, he showcased a dazzling array<br />
        of skills from scorching pole positions, commanding victories – even when his car caught fire<br />
        twice at Silverstone – to an ability to muscle his way through the pack. Winning<br />
        back-to-back championships also taught Leclerc how to handle pressure, another useful tool<br /> 
        in the big pond of Formula 1 racing.<br />
        Stepping up to F1 in 2018, Leclerc showed flashes of ballistic pace on Saturdays<br />
        and racing brilliance on Sundays, dragging his Sauber beyond its limits – and earning<br />
        himself a money-can’t-buy race seat at Ferrari for 2019, stepping into the shoes<br />
        of the Scuderia’s last world champion, Kimi Raikkonen.<br />
        There he immediately put the cat among the proverbial pigeons, unafraid to go<br />
        wheel-to-wheel with established number one, Sebastian Vettel. A maiden<br />
        F1 victory at Spa was followed by another a week later on Ferrari’s hallowed<br />
        home turf of Monza. The tifosi had found another new hero – who then became<br />
        the first man to out-score Vettel over a season with the Scuderia, a feat he repeated<br />
        in crushing fashion the following year.<br />
        The 2020 and ’21 seasons bore little fruit for Ferrari, but Leclerc maintained<br />
        his resolve to emerge a true title contender in 2022. With three wins, 11 podiums<br />
        and nine pole positions, he was the only man able to consistently take the fight to<br />
        champion Max Verstappen - a feat he and the Scuderia were sadly unable to repeat<br />
        in subsequent campaigns.Out of the car, Leclerc is modest and<br />
        thoughtful - but then he is on his own very personal mission.<br />
        This exciting young talent is racing for his late father Herve and his friend<br />
        and mentor Jules Bianchi, the F1 driver who died in 2015.<br />
        On the evidence so far, he is doing them both proud.
