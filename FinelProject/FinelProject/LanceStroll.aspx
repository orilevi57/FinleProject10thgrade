    <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left:20px">Biography</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px">
        There is no such thing as too much too soon for Stroll, a teenage sensation<br />
        with a wet weather predilection. One of the cool kids on the grid, Stroll<br />
        was unveiled shortly after his 18th birthday by Williams – before he<br />
        finished high school and got his road licence. Stroll meant business in his<br />
        debut 2017 season, setting records on the way. An opportunistic racer<br />
        he bounded onto the podium in Baku, the youngest rookie to do so. As the<br />
        son of a wealthy entrepreneur, Stroll is used to a champagne lifestyle<br />
        but now he knows the fizz tastes all the sweeter on the rostrum.<br />
        Then in Monza he mastered the downpours to become the youngest<br />
        driver in history to line up on the front row.<br />
        A single-minded starter, the Canadian loves to make up places on the<br />
        opening lap and fight through to the points. Stroll has the potential<br />
        to be a long-term fixture in Formula 1 – as amply illustrated by<br />
        a maiden pole and another two podiums in 2020.<br />
        Those came after his father Lawrence led the consortium that took<br />
        over Force India midway through the 2018 season, and then transformed it<br />
        from Racing Point to Aston Martin for 2021. The future looks bright for<br />
        both the team and their young driver – and even if it rains then<br />
        Stroll can keep on motoring at the sharp end of the pack.
